Waybar is a status bar for Wayland. It's a great way to keep track of your system's status and get quick access to your applications.

@modules/home-manager/apps/waybar.nix has the configuration and additional scripts are in @modules/home-manager/apps/waybar/*

We configure all the css in the @modules/home-manager/apps/waybar.nix file directly. For documetnation on the css see [./waybar-css.md](./waybar-css.md).
