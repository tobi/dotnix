This is a nix repository. 

# Dotfiles in Nix

* `home/*` home-manager dotfile configuration
* `machines/*` - configuration.*.nix for homelab boxes

## Rules

we are using determined nix. We always use flakes. We make things as simple and self contained as possible. We don't need to create all sorts of shell scripts or whatever. 

- always write the inputs seciton last in a flake
- use the nixos-mcp server to figure out the finer details of nixos packages
